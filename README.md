# Predict-Churn-Rate-Using-Random-Forest-and-ANN-models

## Introduction:
Credit card churn is the loss of a credit card customer, either through cancellation or non-renewal of their account. A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more
customers leaving their credit card services. They would really investigate the underlying reasons behind customer churn, so they can take proactive measures to engage with customers, offer improved services, and potentially reverse their decision to discontinue the services. We are hired to analyze this issue, so we would explore the
following questions by fitting in machine learning models:
1. Which customer segments are more likely to churn?
2. What are the key factors influencing churn?
3. How accurate is our churn prediction model?
4. What actions can be taken to retain high-risk customers?
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust churn prediction model that can accurately identify potential churners among bank customers. Through the analysis of various customer-related data such as transaction history, demographics, account activity, and customer interactions, the model aims to predict which customers are most likely to churn in the near future. By utilizing sophisticated machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics techniques, the model can identify patterns and indicators that are indicative of potential churn, allowing banks to take proactive measures to retain these customers and minimize customer attrition. Ultimately, the development of an accurate churn prediction model can significantly contribute to the reduction of customer rates and improve overall customer retention for banks.
